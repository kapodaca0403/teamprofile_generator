## Description

This is a Team Profile Generator that allows you to set up profiles for your team members and managers. You can set up each profile by adding their name, email, github profile and their position. You can add a Manager, Intern and Engineer. Everything needed to be input will be the same except with smaller differences like for Intern you will need to add school and with Manager you will need to add the office number. Each profile will have an add ID.
